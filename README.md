# Phase_1_project
Aviation Analysis
## Overview
The project focuses on analysis aviation data based on crashes from 1962 to 2023 and create useful insights from the dataset.
## Business Understanding
The primary goal of this project is to support strategic decision-making in the aviation sector by identifying low-risk aircraft models based on historical crash data. With the aviation industry being capital-intensive and safety-critical, understanding the patterns behind aircraft accidents is essential for companies planning to invest in or expand their aviation-related ventures. By uncovering trends and risk factors in past crashes, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that reduce operational risks, enhance safety standards, and improve the long-term profitability and sustainability of business decisions in this domain.
## Data Understanding
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed records of aviation accidents and incidents. It comprises 88,889 rows and 31 columns, capturing a wide range of variables related to aircraft crashes between 1962 and 2023.
Some of the key columns include:
* Aircraft category - specifying the type of aircraft involved.
* Total fatal injuries - indicating the number of fatalities resulting from each incident.
* Location - where the accident occurred.
* Total uninjured - showing how many individuals were unharmed.
* Engine type - detailing the type of engine used in the aircraft.
Additional fields include information such as the aircraft make and model, weather conditions. Understanding the structure, data types, and distribution of these variables is essential before any analysis can be performed. Special attention is given to identifying and addressing missing or inconsistent data, interpreting categorical features, and transforming variables where necessary to ensure the dataset is clean, reliable, and ready for analysis.
## Data Analysis
Using the cleaned dataset of 88,889 records and 31 features, the analysis focuses on identifying patterns and trends related to aviation accidents. Key variables such as aircraft category, engine type, total fatal injuries, location, and total uninjured are explored to uncover:
* High-risk aircraft categories and engine types
* Geographical locations with frequent incidents
* Severity of accidents based on fatalities and uninjured counts
Visualizations such as bar charts are used to present insights clearly. The goal is to highlight low-risk aircraft models and safety patterns that can guide the company in making informed investment decisions.
## Conclusion
Some of the conclusions include,
* Miami and Los Angeles are areas to be avoided due to the fatality of their accidents and several accidents have happened in those areas.
* Airplanes are the best option to invest in even though they still have a high fatality rate in their crashes.
* Turbo fan seems the best engine as it is related to more uninjured individuals and less fatally injured.
* VMC weather condition is the best condition to travel in for the pilots except that they also have a high fatality rate in their crashes etc.<br>
