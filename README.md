# Phase_1_project
Aviation Analysis
## Overview
The project focuses on analysis aviation data based on crashes from 1962 to 2023 and create useful insights from the dataset.
## Business Understanding
The main objective of this project is determining the low-risk aircraft in which the company can venture into in their new business endeavor. I used some categories such as number of casualties in the crashes in order to determine the aircraft with least casualties from their crashes.
## Data Understanding
The dataset was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses). The dataset has a total of 31 columns and 88889 rows. Some of the columns include,
* aircraft category
* total fatal injuries
* location of the incidents
* total uninjured
* engine type, among others.
## Data Analysis
I cleaned data, did analysis & visualization, and gained valuable insights and information from the data.
## Conclusion
Some of the conclusions include,
* Miami and Los Angeles are areas to be avoided due to the fatality of their accidents and several accidents have happened in those areas.
* Airplanes are the best option to invest in even though they still have a high fatality rate in their crashes
* VMC weather condition is the best condition to travel in for the pilots except that they also have a high fatality rate in their crashes etc.
